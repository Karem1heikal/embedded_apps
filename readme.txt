In this project, we have designed and implemented an advanced calculator using 8051 microcontroller, LCD and keypad. The calculator can perform seven operations: multiplication, division, subtraction, addition, factorial, reciprocal and square. The calculator has some features such as clearing single digit, displaying error and overflow messages, and limiting the input and output data to two and four digits respectively. We have used 8051 assembly language to program the microcontroller, and divided our code into three sections: main program, LCD programming and keypad programming. We have interfaced the LCD and the keypad with the microcontroller using 8-bit mode, and scanned the keypad to detect the user input. We have also used the ALU of the microcontroller to perform the calculations, and stored the operands and the operator in specific registers. We have tested our calculator with various inputs and outputs, and verified its functionality and accuracy. We have learned how to use 8051 microcontroller, LCD and keypad to create a useful and interactive device. We have also learned how to write assembly code, use subroutines and functions, and handle errors conditions. We have demonstrated our skills and knowledge in embedded systems and digital electronics.
