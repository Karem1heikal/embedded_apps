In this project we are going to know how to interface your lcd with your keypad by using microcontroller AT89S52 and 8051 assembly language to make an advanced calculator performs seven operations including multiplication, division, subtraction, addition , factorial , reciprocal and square operations with some features .we are treating with keypad as input device from which we are receiving the date and lcd as output device we displaying the data .  
we limited our operations with 2_digits_operands as maximum and 4_digits_result as maximum. we added also clearing single  digit feature if we want to correct or write another digit instead of it, sending an error message in some cases like entering any sign as first input   like + - / * , dividing any number by zero ,sending an overflow message if we want to treat with data over 2_digits_ size .our flow through the program we are firstly going to chick  on each input if it is data or operator ,and then we store operand_1,operand_2 and the operator into specific registers and going to calculate the result .we divided our program into three sections ,main_program section , lcd_programming  section and  keypad_programming  section
